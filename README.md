# **Data Pipeline with Reddit, Airflow, Celery, Postgres, S3, AWS Glue, Athena, and Redshift**

## **Overview**
This project implements a robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for processing Reddit data and loading it into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse. By integrating multiple tools and services, the pipeline ensures scalability, reliability, and efficient data processing.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Extraction**: Collects Reddit data using APIs or other sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Processes and cleans data using Celery and AWS Glue.
- **Data Storage**: Uses Amazon S3 for intermediate data storage and PostgreSQL for task metadata storage.
- **Data Analysis**: Leverages Amazon Athena for querying transformed data.
- **Data Warehousing**: Loads processed data into Amazon Redshift for further analysis.

## **Architecture**

### **Tools and Services**
1. **Apache Airflow**  
   - Orchestrates and schedules the ETL pipeline tasks.
   - Monitors workflow execution and logs task progress.

2. **Celery**  
   - Executes distributed tasks for data extraction and transformation in parallel.

3. **PostgreSQL**  
   - Stores metadata related to task execution, pipeline progress, and intermediate results.

4. **Amazon S3**  
   - Serves as a staging area for raw and processed data during the pipeline.

5. **AWS Glue**  
   - Performs large-scale data transformation and cleaning.

6. **Amazon Athena**  
   - Queries the data stored in S3 using SQL for quick analysis.

7. **Amazon Redshift**  
   - Acts as the data warehouse for storing and analyzing large-scale processed data.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Extraction**
   - Airflow triggers Celery workers to fetch Reddit data using APIs.
   - Extracted data is stored temporarily in S3.

2. **Data Transformation**
   - AWS Glue jobs are initiated to clean and normalize the data.
   - Processed data is saved back into a structured format in S3.

3. **Data Validation**
   - Athena queries are run to validate the transformed data for correctness.

4. **Data Loading**
   - Transformed and validated data is loaded from S3 into Amazon Redshift for long-term storage and analysis.

5. **Monitoring**
   - Airflow monitors the entire pipeline, logs failures, and retries tasks when necessary.
